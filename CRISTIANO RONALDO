CRISTIANO RONALDO

THE CURRENT ERA OF SOCCER IS DOMINATED BY TWO GAINTS:CRISTIANO RONALDO AND LIONAL MESSI.THE TWO NAMES HAVE SCOOPED EVERY INDIVISUAL AWARD OVER THE PAST DECADE,AND DESPITE THEIR ADVANCED AGES (33 AND 30,RESPECTIVELY),THEY SHOW NO SIGN OF SLOWIMG DOWN.AS THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE,WHICH OF THEM IT IS ?THE PHENOMINAL PORTUGUESE RONALDO OR ONE MAN ARMY LIONAL MESSI.

BOTH RONALDO AND MESSI HAVE IMPRESSIVE STAT BUT A CLOSER LOOK AT THEM PROVES THAT MESSI MAKES BETTER DECISION AND MORE IMPORTANTELY BRINGS GREATER VALUE FOR HIS TEAM.MESSI IS NOT ONLY A BETTER SOCCER PLAYER AND GIFTED PLAYMAKER,HE ALSO MAKES EVERYONE AROUND HIM A BETTER PLAYER.A TRUE LEADER, HE BRINGS HIS TEAM TOGETHER.NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE MORE ASSIST AND KEY PASSES THAN RONALDO,HE IS ALWAYS USING HIS PHENOMENAL VISION TO KEEP HIS TEAMMATES INVOLVED.HE HAS GREAT TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE,FINDING FREE SPACES TO MOVE INTO,RECIEVING THE BALL AND THEN LAYING IT OFF TO A TEAM MATE TO BUILD ATTACK.
WHEREAS THE GAME HAS BECOME FASTER AND MORE DEMANDIND IN MOST ASPECT OF PHYSICALITY.WHILE MESSI MESSI MIGHT HAVE MORE TALENT,BUT IN PHYSICAL ASPECT RONALDO IS MOREAHED OF MESSI.HIS ATHLETICISM IS SECOND TO NONE;HE COMBINES DIZZYING PACE WITH POWERFUL SHOOTING AND JUMPING ABILITY OF AN NBA STAR,WHICH MAKES HIS HEADER A THREAT TO THE OPPOSITION.
